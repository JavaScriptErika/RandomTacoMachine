Salmon tacos with avocado and mango salsa
=================

This taco is the ultimate blend of salt and sweet with some spiciness.

1. Use a taco shell of your choice and top with some [pan-seared salmon](../base_layers/pan_seared_salmon.md).
2. Make the [avocado and mango salsa](../condiments/avocado_mango_cilantro_salsa.md) and add it to the taco.

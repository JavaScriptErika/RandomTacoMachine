Sriracha Marinade
===================

Alone on a Saturday night, I put on Iron Maiden, cubed up a pork chop and whipped this marinade together:

* 2-3 Tbs sriracha sauce
* couple pinches of Mexican Oregano
* good shake of smokey paprika
* tsp or so of ground ancho chile
* pinch of salt

Get this coated nicely over everything before frying or grilling on high heat.

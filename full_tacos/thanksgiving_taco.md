Thanksgiving Tacos
==================

You know what would make Thanksgiving a lot better? If you tossed everything great about it into a taco. This recipe combines a few favorites from Tacofancy along with a [new riff](/condiments/cranberry_salsa.md) on a Thanksgiving-appropriate salsa. There's a 98% chance that these will be featured on my Thanksgiving day table (the 2% is I die before Thanksgiving).

Let's do this
-------------

You're going to need to prepare the following taco objects: 

* [@Deezthugs' Smokey Turkey](/base_layers/smokey_turkey.md)
* [Sweet Potato and Apple Hash](/mixins/sweet_potato_and_apple_hash.md)
* [Cranberry Salsa](/condiments/cranberry_salsa.md)
* [Salsa de Aguacate](/condiments/salsa_de_aguacate.md)

Notes
-----

* Give yourself plenty of time here, the [Smokey Turkey](/base_layers/smokey_turkey.md) recipe takes a while. Frankly, it ain't Thanksgiving if you're not spending most of your day in the kitchen getting this shit together. 

* The [Cranberry Salsa](/condiments/cranberry_salsa.md) is best assembled pretty close to eating. You can make the cranberries well ahead of time, but the longer this thing sits, the more it just tastes like cranberry sauce.

* You can probably cut the size of the [Salsa de Aguacate](/condiments/salsa_de_aguacate.md) recipe by a third--the recipe makes a lot (then again, just means you've got toppings for another taco later in the week).

* If you really want to make the day extra-special, make your own [Fresh Corn Tortillas] (/shells/Fresh_corn_tortillas.md)

* THANKSGIVING POWER ACTIVATE

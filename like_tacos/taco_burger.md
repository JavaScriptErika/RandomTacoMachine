Taco Burger
==============

A one-time Taco Bell classic (think late '70s-early-'80s era, if you can), the taco burger is now all but extinct.

## Ingredients

* Hamburger Buns
* [Traditional Ground Beef](../base_layers/ground_beef_traditional_us.md) (or perhaps the [Overly Seasoned Ground Beef](../base_layers/overlyseasonedgroundbeef.md))
* [Cheese](../mixins/cheese_traditional_us.md)
* [Lettuce](../mixins/lettuce_traditional_us.md)
* [Tomatoes](../mixins/tomatoes_traditional_us.md)
* Hot Sauce

You should, of course, feel free to fancy your burgers up any way you wish, but every now and then a low-rent meal goes a long way.

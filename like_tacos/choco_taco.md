A dessert taco, the [Choco Taco](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choco_Taco) is more easily purchased than made, but, if you're up to it, a homemade Choco Taco is pretty fantastic.

## Waffle Taco Shell

### Ingredients

* 1 pack frozen waffles, thawed

### Directions

* Heat your oven to 350 degrees.
* Using a rolling pin (or more likely, if you're really trying this, a wine bottle), flatten each waffle as much as you can. You may want to do this over wax paper or some other non-stick surface.
* Drape the waffles over something long and thin (and oven-safe) and bake them until they are firm (5-10 minutes).

These waffle taco shells would be good for breakfast tacos, but are better for ice cream and related toppings.

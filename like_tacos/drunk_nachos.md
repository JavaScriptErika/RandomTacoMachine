Drunk Nachos
=================

For those shameful late-night moments after da club when all you need are cheese and chips.

### Ingredients

* One bag of tortilla chips
* A handful (or two... or three..) of [cheese](../mixins/cheese_traditional_us.md)
* Any random stuff you have lying around you think would taste good delivered atop a bed of cheese and chips. Any leftover [mixins](../mixins) or [condiments](../condiments) you have laying around from a proper taco dinner would be BOMB.

### Directions

* Spread a single layer of chips on top of a microwave safe plate.
* Throw that cheese on top. Try to distribute it evenly.
* Nuke the whole plate in the microwave for 1 minute on high power. Don't even think about using the oven or broiler for this. You're drunk.
* Pull the delicious cheesy mess out of the microwave oven. Top with whatever you found scrounging around in your fridge or leave as is.
* STUFF YOUR FACE!

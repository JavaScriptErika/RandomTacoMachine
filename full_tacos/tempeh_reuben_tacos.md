# Tempeh reuben tacos 

Vegetarian; vegan without cheese
--------------------------------

1. Prepare the [Pepper Tempeh filling](/base_layers/pepper_tempeh.md)
2. Serve in a corn tortilla.
3. Top with sauerkraut.  Homemade sauerkraut is particularly delicious and I found [this recipe](http://www.wildfermentation.com/making-sauerkraut-2/) relatively easy to follow.
4. Sprinkle with carroway seeds.
3. Optionally, top with swiss cheese. For vegans, I've found sliced avocado to be a nice creamy substitute.
4. Top with a spicy mustard.

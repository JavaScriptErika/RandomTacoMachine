Beef Vindaloo on Naan
=================

For those who enjoy indian food and for those whose mother wants tacos-esque things for dinner and you both know that you have delicious naan bread to use before it expires.

### Ingredients

* A piece of [naan](../shells/naan.md) bread (normal sized for a very large taco, or the tiny ones from Costco if you want deliciously tiny ones) 
* Ground [beef](../base_layers/ground_beef_traditional_us.md)
* Some [bellpepper](../base_layers/bellpepper.md)
* Some [onion](../base_layers/onion.md)
* some pre-made [vindaloo](../condiments/vindaloo_sauce.md) sauce (You could make your own, but using pre-made is the easy and lazy, perhaps preferable, way out)

1. Chop the preferred amount of onion and bellpepper lengthwise, put the sauce in a saucepan, prepare the beef by chopping it up into small bits. 
2. Heat it all until the ground beef, onion, bellpepper, and vindaloo are all cooked completely, simultaneously heat the naan in the oven toward the end of the cooking cycle. Either master timing, or allow it to master you.
3. If not already combined, combine the beef, bellpepper, and onion into a mixture of possibly dry greatness. 
4. If you would like, add the vindaloo into the beef, bellpepper, and onion mixture to mix the sauce into it nicely. 
5. Apply your mixture of ingredients to the top of the naan bread, careful not to overflow the great near-taco-taco. 
6. If you have not already sauced your taco with the vindaloo, vindaloo it. Do it. 
7. Much enjoyment.

* Chop vegetables into 1/2 inch pieces
* Heat a large dutch oven over medium high-heat with a few tablespoons of olive oil
* Sear the pork, fat side down, until golden brown and crispy

* Bring to a boil

##Build the Taco
* Once the pork belly has finished cooking, slice into 1/4 inch thick slabs - use 2 slices per taco, or more if desired
* Add green tomatillo salsa, fresh avocado, and onions and cilantro to garnish
* Best in corn tortillas, but flour or wheat tortillas are also acceptible

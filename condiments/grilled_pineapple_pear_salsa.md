__Ingredients__
* 1/2 ripe pineapple, trimmed and sliced
* 1 large medium-firm pear sliced into 1/4 inch slices
* 1 large red bell pepper, seeded and quartered

* 1/8 teaspoon ground ginger
* 1/8 teaspoon ground cumin

__Instructions__
* Sautee red onions, pineapple, red bell peppers, pears, and jalapeno in olive oil on high heat. Do not move vegetables and pineapples around until they're slightly charred and caramelized.

* Mix in cilantro, lime juice, ground ginger, ground cumin, and salt and pepper.

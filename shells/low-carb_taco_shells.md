For those who are on an Atkins or Low carb diet this is a recipe I found on you tube for a low carb taco shells using cheese.

> Use real cheese instead of the processed stuff.

1. Take a round-sliced piece of provolone and place it on a plate.

2. Microwave for 15-30 seconds

3. Fold/form into a taco shape by hand.

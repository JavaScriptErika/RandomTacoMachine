I'm too old for the television show iCarly to have any cultural resonance, so I only learned that spaghetti tacos were a thing from this [New York Times trend piece](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/dining/06tacos.html).  When some [farmer friends](http://chicagopatchworkfarms.com/) gave me a lot of squash, I did what I always do when I don't know what to do with ingredients and tried to make it into a taco.  This is a more adult version of the food gag, or perhaps a way to compell kids to eat a somewhat weird but delicious seasonal vegetable.

## Components

* [spaghetti squash](../base_layers/spaghetti_squash.md)
* [tomato sauce](../condiments/tomato_sauce_above_average.md)
* fresh basil
* grated [Grana Padano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grana_(cheese)) cheese
* spicy giardiniera (if you're into that kind of thing.  I eat on almost anything)

## Preparation

Bake the spaghetti squash and scoop it into strands.  While the squash is baking, prepare the tomato sauce.  Toss the squash with the sauce and spoon onto tortillas, or more authentically, taco shells.  Use scissors to snip thin strips of fresh basil on top of the tacos and sprinkle withe the cheese.

The squash can be pretty moist, so if you're using corn tortillas, you'll want to double-up.
